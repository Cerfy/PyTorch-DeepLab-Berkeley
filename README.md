# PyTorch-DeepLab-Berkeley

This is an implementation of SpeedingHZL's DeepLab ResNet PyTorch on the [Berkeley Deep Drive Dataset](http://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/index.html) for semantic segmentation. 
The original author tested the pre-trained ResNet model on the PASCAL VOC dataset. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/speedinghzl/Pytorch-Deeplab). 

## Acknowledgement
This code is borrowed from [SpeedingHZL's DeepLab ResNet PyTorch](https://github.com/speedinghzl/Pytorch-Deeplab). I have no intention of copying the models or using
the code for any commercial purposes. I am experimenting the model on my capstone project which involves Scene Understanding of Self Driving Cars.
